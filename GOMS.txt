  3. Use O3 to select the email.
  4. Use O4 to delete the email.

- M2 (Alternate Method):
  1. Use a search feature to find the specific email (O1).
  2. Use O3 and O4 to delete the email.

Selection Rules:
- If the user can quickly find the email in the inbox, use Method M1.
- If the email is buried or the user remembers specific details about it, use Method M2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Goal: Close Window

Goal: The user wants to close a window on their computer or application.

Operators:
- O1: Click on the "X" button in the window corner.
- O2: Use keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Alt + F4).
- O3: Right-click on the window title bar and select "Close."

Methods:
- M1:
  1. Use O1 to click the "X" button to close the window.

- M2:
  1. Use O2 to press Alt + F4 to close the current window.

- M3 (Alternate Method):
  1. Use O3 to right-click the title bar.
  2. Select the "Close" option from the context menu.

Selection Rules:
- If the "X" button is easily accessible and visible, use Method M1.
